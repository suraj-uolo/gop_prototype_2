The optional-silence phone SIL occupies 35.2% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 85.6% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence SIL occupies 24.3% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 0.0 hours of data, or 0.0 hours if SIL frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences SIL comprise 15.4% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (13,24.5,37)
